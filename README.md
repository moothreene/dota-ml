My React.js project which includes connection to my other project (dota machine learning match outcome predictor)

# How to use:
1. Run main.py from https://github.com/moothreene/dota-ml-predict  -
   This setups the api for sending requests with dota picks and getting responses with a win probability
   
2. Run "npm start" command in cmd from dota-ml js project directory

# IMPORTANT

Predictions may not work as intended since that code is old and does not for example calculate new heroes that were added recently
